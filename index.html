          Client Side Applications
        </h3>
        <p>
          I work on the front end of <a href="enstratius.com">Dell Cloud Manager</a>, a fairly large Angular application.
          Recently we have been struggling with platform standarization with other teams, which has lead me to ask why
          our application is structured as a client side app communicating with a server side api.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is certainly the flavor of the week for front end developers to work on 'rich' applications. But if I'm going
          to evangelize this approach to other teams I need to understand what the real benefits of the pattern are.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keeps user context closer to the user. This avoids networks trips to get user specific data. The server also
            does not need to maintain a large user state. That reduces server load and makes it easier to run multiple
            servers without using sticky sessions or distributed sessions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Separates concerns, keeping UX functionality clearly split from business logic. This affords the potential
            for multiple UX clients (browser, phone, native app).
          </li>
          <li>
            Puts application decisions as close to the user as possible, moving the application from being batch orientated
            towards being interactive. A good interactive experience responds within 100ms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I suspect that the real value of client side apps it the move towards interaction. Being able to respond to input
          immediately is critical to providing sophisticated interactions with complicated models.

          Practice Writing
        </h3>
        <p>
          I know that I need to practice writing. Since I graduated college I havent really written anything of significant length. A couple of reports and proposals, but I doubt Ive even managed one a year over the last fifteen years. It is time to change that. Even if these posts are hardly longer than a tweet it is a start.
